# ðŸ¥ª Sandwich Shop CLI

A Java-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) deli ordering system. Users can order sandwiches, drinks, and chips, view their cart, and checkout. Orders are saved to individual files and transaction logs for manager viewing. This is another capstone and an extenion of my Capstone Repository(https://github.com/AbrahamGhani/Capstones) most of my commits were made to that repository instead of this one by my error.

## ðŸ§  Interesting Code Example

```java
double price = basePrice;
for (Topping topping : toppings) {
    if (isExtra(topping.getName())) {
        price += topping.isCheese() ? getCheesePrice(size, true) : getMeatPrice(size, true);
    }
}
```

This logic adjusts sandwich pricing based on topping type and size.
